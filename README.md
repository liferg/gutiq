# GutIQ
GutIQ is an intelligent, data-driven tool designed to uncover what’s actually triggering gastrointestinal symptoms, whether it’s food sensitivities, the timing of meals, lifestyle factors like sleep or exercise, patterns you can’t detect manually, or even genetics.

With GutIQ, you log your data in a simple, timestamped journal:
* What you eat and when
* Symptoms and timing
* Sleep, exercise, stress, travel, and routines
* Optional genetic data

GutIQ integrates all of these inputs and uses machine learning to surface the underlying patterns, both the obvious ones and the ones you’d never notice on your own. It can highlight correlations, detect triggers, and generate personalized predictions about what is most likely causing your symptoms.

**The Goal:**
To finally give people clarity about their digestive health, not through restrictive diets or guesswork, but through data, personalization, and intelligent analysis. GutIQ helps you understand your own body at a level that traditional methods simply can’t match.
